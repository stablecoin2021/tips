## Simple Summary
 
This tip mainly describes SPV and how it works on cross-chain projects. In addition, it also discusses a solution to TRON version SPV.
 
## Abstract
 
SPV plays a very important role in cross-chain projects since it provides fast transaction verification on lightweight clients such as wallets. Those clients only store block header information for verification purpose. However, there are likely to be tampering attacks on block producing and confirmation stages, which may lead to chain switch or forking. With TRON version SPV, TRON version SPV ensures the correctness of blocks that you use to do SPV.
 
## Motivation
 
In the Bitcoin world, most users do not have mining machines, and nor do they have enough resources to run a full node. For now, you need 200GB hard drive space to store the entire blockchain data and a solid state drive is preferred. For most users, what they need is only selling and buying. Since they don't care about the verification process, a mining machine seems a bit redundant. Here's when TRON version SPV comes into play. SPV is lightweight, as it stores only block headers, only a small MBs space is required. From the block headers, we are able to know whether the transaction appears in a block, which can prove whether it has been verified.
 
TRON version of SPV improves the accuracy and security of block query, which safeguards the verification process of blocks and transactions. 
 
## Specification
 
### Merkle Tree  
Basically, the Merkle tree, named after Ralph C. Merkle, who is a famous cryptographer, is like a hash tree, which uses a hash function to connect with each node. The value of leaf node in Merkle tree is a data block hash, while hash value of non-leaf node is a hash of hashing several other nodes' hash values. It's like we can hash two leaves' hash value into a non-leave hash, which is the root of those two.

                           <center>Figure 1</center> 
        
- Merkle proof         
 Merkle proof is the Merkle path and block height obtained from the full node.
 
- Merkle path
  Merkle path is a hash path that consists of node hash values from bottom leave node all the way to top node where node hash values are computed by given transaction hash values. For example, given transaction D, the corresponding hash value is N3, the Merkle path should be N2--N4 since we use N2 to get N5 by N5 = hash(N2,N3) and the same root by doing hash(N4,N5).
 
 
- Features:
    1.  highly efficient: To validate transactions, just compare the root hash of those transactions, see if they are equal or not.
 
    2.  highly secure: If transaction C changes, then it will lead to hash value change of N2, N5 and root. So, it is impossible to create a fake transaction within SPV. In addition, fast troubleshooting can be done by comparing the different hash values of the nodes. Like the above example, From root → N5 → N2 hash value will change, and then we could locate the change of transaction C.
 
 
### Epoch  
   Every six hours is called Epoch in TRON. In other words, it is a cycle for producing a certain number of blocks.
 
### SR List
  SR list is a type of data structure used for block verification, which includes srAddress. SRL will be calculated in each maintenance period, which stores a list of SR addresses on the next epoch. For block verification, just check if there are 2/3+1 SRs that sign the blocks in the SR list.
 
```
message SRL {
 repeated bytes srAddress = 1;
}
 
```
 
 
#### Threshold Signature
 
1. At least t  participants in the group can collaborate to generate a valid signature on behalf of the group signature.
2. Any one who plays the role of a veriﬁer can use the group’s public key to verify the group signature with-out identifying the identities of the signers
 
### Verifier
 nodes that trigger the pBFT consensus procedure for blocks produced by SRs
 
## Rationale
 
### Algorithm on Merkle Tree
- Generate a a Merkle proof
  1. given a transaction hash value
  2. query from full node to get list of transactions hash values in associated block and mark as leave nodes
  3. iterate all leaf nodes by group of two at each pass and compute each two leave node parent hash and add it into parent list and find leaf node that matches the given transaction hash value
  4. add the other node hash value of this group into Merkle proof list and mark their parent node
  5. iterate parent list by group of two at each pass and compute each two node hash value and add it into temporary parent list and find marked node
  6. add another node of this group and mark their parent node
  7. check step 5's parent nodes size , if bigger than 1 , then to step 6, otherwise return Merkle proof list
  8. go to step 5, use temporary parent list to replace leave nodes and the same process
 
Take Figure 1 as an example, be given Transaction D and then calculate Transaction D hash value--N3.  From step 2, we can get a list of all transaction hash values [N0,N1,N2,N3]. And take a group of two and do iteration: [N0,N1],[N2,N3]; at the second pass, we can find N3 and add N2 into Merkle proof list([N2]) and meanwhile compute parent hash list as [N4,N5] and mark N5.  Next, iterate [N4,N5] and add N4 into the Markle proof list, which is [N2,N4].
 
Take the Merkle proof list [N2,N4] and N3, we can compute Merkle root by doing Hash(N4,Hash(N3,N2)).
If you are more interested in how to implement it, feel free to check the function: generateProofPath in our java tron codebase.
 
-  Valid Merkle proof
  1. Give a Merkle proof list and Transaction associated value N3
  2. do result = N3 and iteration proof list
  3. do result = hash(result, element in the proof list)
  4. get Merkle root and compare with local Merkle root
  5. if equal, then valid , otherwise, fake transaction

### SPV process
1. Get the transaction hash.
2. From a full node, get the corresponding Merkle proof. For detail see generate Merkle proof
3. Based on the Merkle path, do Markle proof and finally get Merkle root. For detail see valid Merkle proof
4. Compare local Merkle root with the calculated one.
5. Judge if the transaction is legal on the basis that whether the result is equivalent to the local Merkle Root.
 
Basically, given a transaction hash and use that hash query full node to get block header as well as Merkle path. Based on the Merkle path and feature of Merkle tree, we can easily calculate the new Merkle root and then we can compare with the local Merkle root.If it matches, then it is a valid transaction;otherwise, it is a fake one.
 
### SPV on tron
 
In DPOS consensus every slot is assigned to the only legal SR. So within one schedule if verifiers know the legal SR list they can verify every block header easily. Since verifiers don't process most transactions including vote transactions they have no way to know the voting result. In other words they are unable to know the next legal SR list. The focus of this problem is on how to handle the maintenance period correctly. Based on the above reasons we can solve this problem by recording SR lists in one type of BPFT messages which are sent by the previous legal SR list we trust.
 
Most process of TRON version SPV is the same as the SPV process as above,the only difference is that we add SR list and SR signature in the pBFT message. So we can use SR list to validate block header and SR signature to valid SRs, which can safeguard our SPV process.
 
## Implementation

Leaf: Merkle tree leaf node which contains left and right child, hash value and remark status 
 
```typescript
 
public class Leaf {

```
 
ProofLeaf: Merkle tree proof data structure which contains the hash value of nodes in the Merkle path and a boolean value indicating left or right node. 
 
```typescript
public class ProofLeaf {
 
 private Sha256Hash hash;
 private boolean leftOrRight;//left leaf is false,and the right one is true
 
 public ProofLeaf(Sha256Hash hash, boolean leftOrRight) {
   this.hash = hash;
   this.leftOrRight = leftOrRight;
 }
}
```
